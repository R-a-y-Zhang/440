This has not been completed. It will take a bit of work before it can run.
What has been completed, however, is an A* implementation that can solve a
120x180 grid in under 40 seconds (on a 4.0GHz processor, mileage may vary)
and a rudimentary visualization of the map and the path the algorithm took.
It isn't interactive yet, and there is still some tweaking that needs to be
done to make the implementation faster and more efficient but right now,
that's what is up.
